# Additional requirements for running IDS with integration
# These require system libraries to be installed first:
# sudo apt-get install python3.13-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev libnfnetlink-dev libpcap-dev

# Note: netfilterqueue may need to be built from source for Python 3.13
# If installation fails, try: pip install --no-binary netfilterqueue netfilterqueue
